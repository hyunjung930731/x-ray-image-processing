# X-ray Image Processing

## Description
This project focuses on processing Chest PA X-ray images to perform segmentation and contour detection of objects. The notebook demonstrates techniques such as thresholding, image inversion, and contour extraction to highlight specific regions in X-ray images, enabling further medical image analysis.

## Features
- Segmentation of Chest PA X-ray images using thresholding techniques.
- Object contour detection using OpenCV.
- Visualization of detected contours for easy analysis.
- Ready-to-use code for preprocessing X-ray images.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyunjung930731/x-ray-image-processing.git
2. Open the xray_contour.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:

Load a Chest PA X-ray image.
Perform preprocessing (e.g., thresholding and inversion).
Detect and visualize contours.
